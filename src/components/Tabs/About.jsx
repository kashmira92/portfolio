      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h3 style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        Hello! I'm a data science enthusiast on a journey that began with a degree
        in computer science and continued with a master's in data science. My
        journey has led me to spend 2 amazing years as a data engineer at
        Accenture, where I got to roll up my sleeves and dive into the
        fascinating world of data. <br />
        <br />
        I'm particularly drawn to the magic of machine learning and data
        engineeringâ€”it's like uncovering hidden patterns in a treasure trove of
        information. But there's more to it than just the grind! I find joy in
        designing analytical dashboards, transforming data into vivid narratives
        like a storyteller with numbers and charts. <br />
        <br /> When I'm not meticulously curating data or fine-tuning models,
        you'll often find me venturing out, exploring new destinations, and
        relishing the vibrant chaos of local delicacies. Oh, and did I mention
        I'm a bookworm? There's something magical about getting lost in the
        pages of a good book and coming out with a fresh perspective. I'm all
        about embracing life's adventures and constantly evolving through
        learning and growth.
        <br />
        <br /> In a nutshell, I'm fueled by my passion for data science and
        can't wait to see where the next chapter of my journey takes me!.{" "}
